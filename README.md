Huffman_enoding-progam.py is the code for Huffman Encoding Problem, If you execute the program, the Number of Symbols (n) and the Time Taken will be displayed in the results.
log.py is used to generate the theoretical values for the time complexity O(n * n(logn))
graph.py is the code for normalization, the results will be there normalized outputs.
